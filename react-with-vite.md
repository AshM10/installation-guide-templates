# React with Vite

## Setting up with yarn

- To create a new Vite + React project using the ` yarn create ` command, you will need to have Node.js and yarn installed on your system. 
Then, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a new directory for your project, and navigate to it in your terminal.
2. Run the command ` yarn create react-app my-app --template vite ` to create a new Vite + React app. 
This will install the necessary dependencies, including Vite, React, and React DOM, and create a basic project structure for you.
3. Once the installation is complete, navigate to the new project directory by running ` cd my-app `.
4. Run the command ` yarn vite ` to start the development server. This will open a new browser window with your app running. 
You should see the default React "Welcome to React" page displayed on the page.

- That's it! You now have a new Vite + React app set up and running. You can start building your app by adding components and code to the src directory. Vite will automatically reload the page whenever you make a change, so you can see your changes in real-time.
