## [Create React App](https://github.com/AshM10/installation-guide-templates/blob/main/create-react-app.md)

- Create React App is a command-line utility that generates a basic React application for you. 
It is a tool built by the React team at Facebook, and it helps you set up a new React project by creating a development 
environment with a preconfigured build setup and a simple development server. It is designed to be easy to use and 
helps you get your React application up and running quickly.

## [React with Vite](https://github.com/AshM10/installation-guide-templates/blob/main/react-with-vite.md)

- Vite (pronounced like "beet") is a modern frontend development build tool that was created to address some of the issues with traditional frontend build tools, such as Webpack. It is designed to be lightweight, fast, and easy to use, and is especially well-suited for building small-to-medium sized projects.

- Vite is built on top of native ECMAScript modules, and it uses a development server that supports live reloading, so you can see your changes as you make them without having to manually refresh the page. It also has a plugin system that allows you to add additional functionality, such as TypeScript support or pre-processing for CSS and HTML.

- Vite is not part of the React ecosystem, but it can be used as the build tool for a React project. If you are using React with Vite, you will still need to install React and any other dependencies that your project requires.
