# installation-guide-templates üë©üèº‚Äçüíª

Welcome to this repository! 

This repository is intended to provide installation guides and templates for the libraries and frameworks that the author frequently uses.

In addition to the installation guides, this repository also includes templates that can be used as starting points for projects using the covered libraries and frameworks. These templates can save you time by providing a basic structure and set of configuration files that you can use as a foundation for your own projects.

We hope that these resources will be helpful to you as you work with the libraries and frameworks featured in this repository. If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to reach out to the author or open an issue in the repository.

## Getting Started üèÅ

1. You will need to make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed on your system. This may include package managers such as npm or yarn for JavaScript libraries.

2. Once you have the dependencies set up, you can use the provided installation guides to install the various libraries and frameworks that are covered in this repository. The guides should provide step-by-step instructions on how to install and set up each library or framework.

## [Create React App](https://github.com/AshM10/installation-guide-templates/blob/main/create-react-app.md) üÜï

- Create React App is a command-line utility that generates a basic React application for you. 
It is a tool built by the React team at Facebook, and it helps you set up a new React project by creating a development 
environment with a preconfigured build setup and a simple development server. It is designed to be easy to use and 
helps you get your React application up and running quickly.

## [React with Vite](https://github.com/AshM10/installation-guide-templates/blob/main/react-with-vite.md) üèÉüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

- Vite (pronounced like "beet") is a modern frontend development build tool that was created to address some of the issues with traditional frontend build tools, such as Webpack. It is designed to be lightweight, fast, and easy to use, and is especially well-suited for building small-to-medium sized projects.

- Vite is built on top of native ECMAScript modules, and it uses a development server that supports live reloading, so you can see your changes as you make them without having to manually refresh the page. It also has a plugin system that allows you to add additional functionality, such as TypeScript support or pre-processing for CSS and HTML.

- Vite is not part of the React ecosystem, but it can be used as the build tool for a React project. If you are using React with Vite, you will still need to install React and any other dependencies that your project requires.

## [README File App Template](https://github.com/AshM10/installation-guide-templates/blob/main/readme-file-app-template.md) ü§ì

- A README is a text file that provides information about a project or repository. It is often the first file that a user encounters when they access a project, and it is typically used to provide an overview of the project, explain how to set it up and use it, and list any known issues or limitations.

- A README is typically written in plain text, but it can also include formatting and links to other resources. It is commonly used in software projects to provide users with instructions for building and running the code, as well as a list of dependencies and any other requirements. It may also include information about the project's history, contributors, and license.

- In general, a README is an important resource for users to understand and use a project effectively. It helps users get started quickly and can save them time and frustration by providing clear and concise instructions and information.

## [Commit Txt Template](https://github.com/AshM10/installation-guide-templates/blob/main/commit.txt)

- In Git, a commit is a snapshot of the changes made to a repository, or a set of files managed by Git. When you make changes to a repository and want to save those changes permanently, you create a commit. Each commit has a unique identifier, called a commit hash, and a message that describes the changes made in the commit.

- The commit.txt file may contain information about a specific commit, such as the commit hash, the commit message, and the names and locations of the files that were changed in the commit. It is common to use a text file to store this information because it is easy to read and modify.
